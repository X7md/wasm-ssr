# Contributing to webassembly-browser-apps

The WebAssembly Browser Apps project team welcomes contributions from the community. First, we want to thank you for taking the time to contribute!

Please familiarize yourself with the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/vmware/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.

Before you start working with `webassembly-browser-apps`, please read our [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://cla.vmware.com/dco). All contributions to this repository must be signed as described on that page. Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch.

## Ways to contribute

We welcome many different types of contributions and not all of them need a Pull request. Contributions may include:

* New features and proposals
* Documentation
* Bug fixes
* Issue Triage
* Answering questions and giving feedback
* Other related activities

## Getting started

Check our [README.md] file to understand the structure of this project. Then, every folder will include a [README.md] with the instructions for every subproject.

## Contribution Flow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

* Make a fork of the repository within your GitHub account
* Create a topic branch in your fork from where you want to base your work
* Make commits of logical units
* Make sure your commit messages are with the proper format, quality and descriptiveness (see below)
* Push your changes to the topic branch in your fork
* Create a pull request containing that commit

We follow the GitHub workflow and you can find more details on the [GitHub flow documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow).

Example:

```
# After forking the project:
git clone MY_FORK_URL
cd webassembly-browser-apps
git switch -c my-new-feature
git commit -s -S -a
git push origin my-new-feature
```

Then, you can open a Pull Request to the original repository to merge your contribution. Please, check the next section before creating new Pull Requests.

### Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting your pull request, we advise you to use the following:

1. Check if your code changes will pass both code linting checks and unit tests.
2. Ensure your commit messages are descriptive. We follow the conventions on [How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). Be sure to include any related GitHub issue references in the commit message. See [GFM syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown) for referencing issues and commits.
3. Check the commits and commits messages and ensure they are free from typos.
